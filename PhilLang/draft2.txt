 “The History of every major Galactic Civilization tends to pass through three distinct and recognizable phases, those of Survival, Inquiry and Sophistication, otherwise known as the How, Why, and Where phases. For instance, the first phase is characterized by the question 'How can we eat?' the second by the question 'Why do we eat?' and the third by the question 'Where shall we have lunch?”

There is a planet in Galactic Sector ZZ9 Plural Z Alpha that is called by its inhabitants, "Earth".
At the time of this writing, the earthlings have already made it to the *where* phase regarding lunch, but they are only partially out of the *why* phase regarding the use of language.
One of their philosophers, Donald Davidson wrote an article titled *On the Very Idea of a Conceptual Scheme* where he responds to a *why*-type discovery--namely that "reality itself is relative to a scheme: what counts as real in one scheme may not in another" [pg 272].
Davidson argues that this discovery is not as exciting as it first appears and examines several cases where embracing this notion leads either to business-as-usual, or to total incoherence.

Davidson misses a few critical points that--unless they are discovered by the earthlings, may create further delay in their transition from Inquiry to Sophistication.
Particularly, he fails to embrace the proposition he is investigating fully enough to see that he is making a straw man of it.
His pre-relative analysis fails to capture certain merits of the position he is attacking, and no post-relative theoretical toolkit is readily available to him.
In this paper I will sketch the kind of post-relative toolkit that Davidson needs, and then argue that Davidson's criticisms are not so damaging as he claims.

By 'language' I shall mean any form of communication that is offered under the assumption that the listener (or reader, or viewer...) will proceed through a certain ontological process which I will make clear momentarily.
As an example of communication that I do not consider language, suppose I have some food that I don't want to share.
Every time you get near the food, I hit you with a stick.
This relies on my assumption that the stick will cause you pain, and that the pain will act as a deterrent, but it doesn't count as language because pain is not complex enough to support the sort of ontological goings-on that language requires.

In order to receive a communication via language, a listener must abide by the listener's code:
1. When spoken to, you must hold a world in your mind to contain whatever is being said                                
2. If you hear something that refers to something not in the world, create it there                                    
3. If you hear something that refers to something in the world, modify its existence to fit whatever is being said     
4. Speakers may demand multiple such worlds be held, try to keep track of which sentances refer to which worlds        
5. If any of the above create a contradiction, speak up                                                                

Frege describes a process where "if we produce the symbol of an idea which a perception has called to mind, we create in this way a firm, new focus around which further ideas gather".  
Relying on some overlap between our linguistic worlds, I can use Frege's method to manipulate in your mind, the shared world that was created by the fact that I have written this paper and you are reading it.
I can, for example, speak of a kind and considerate Vogon, and by doing so I ask you do abide by 2. and admit such a creature into the world of discourse created by this paper--despite the fact that nobody who has ever met a Vogon would believe that such a thing could be found.

Most of the time, the kind of worlds Earthlings associate with having a language are very large, encapsulating a culture's entire cosmology [Wharf].
That either party reside in such a world is a precondition for 2. and 3. but I also wish to allow for smaller worlds.
These are the places where analytic truths live.
This happens everywhere, but it is most clearly found in the textbooks and classrooms where pure mathematics are studied.
Every other sentence starts with "Let ... be such that ..." and is an alternated re-application of 2. and 3.

This process lends itself to creations of a certain structure, which can be seen in the recursive quality of Chomsky's generative grammars.
It also demands that the listener be equipped with comutational apparatus for parsing such a structure [Fodor].
Beyond this, the listeners code demands some mechanism for universe-simulation.
Otherwise sentences like, "When the art fell off the wall and onto the coffee table, it shattered because it was made of glass," could not be parsed (since resolving the pronoun 'it' requires a cursory understanding of material science that goes beyond parsing.
Given that the only earth-creatures that are even approaching the "Where" stage of language use appear to have a larger than average prefontal cortex, I take it that this portion of their brain that is responsible for the imaginative necessities of discourse-world-building.

This third stage of language use characterized by the question: "Where should this conversation take place?"
There are pragmatics to consider here--this conversation is happening on a page, other ones happen in bars.
But beyond that, the 'where?' question is a rather technical one which asks about which facts ought to be included as analytic and which onese ought to be included as synthetic.

This is where Davidson goes wrong.
He says, "to give up the analytic-synthetic division as basic to the understanding of language is to give up the idea that we can clearly distinguish between theory and language."
But regarding the conceptual relativists's position--it is not that we want to give up the analytic-synthetic division completely, what we want to do is establish that the analytic-synthetic division is itself analytic.

That division is like a volume knob.
We can turn it all the way to analytic, and see the world like Wittgenstein, or we can turn it all the way to synthetic and see the world like Locke.
The question is not, "why is there a knob here?" the question is: "what is an appropriate setting for the current conversation?"

The reason that Davidson misses this is probably that he has never maxed-out that particular knob in the analytic direction.
If he ever did, he would suddenly discover that all of the things he thought were fixed about discourse (or anything else) are actually variable.
Following that, he would find that pretty much all of them were set at an appropriate level and, having analytically reconstructed synthesis, would wind up in the same place he started, but without a bone to pick.

Early on Davidson says that, "we may accept the doctrine that associates having a language with having a conceptual scheme" (272) and he later develops an individuation criterion for conceptual schemes: two conceptual schemes are different if their associated languages cannot be translated into one another.
Based on this, I expect that Davidson would say that by allowing for even more things to go wrong between speaker and listener (perhaps we each take the analytic-synthetic divide to be in different places) I make communication even less likely.  Keeping in mind that the analytic-synthetic divide is essentially a convention regarding which facts are in scope for dissection, and which ones must remain atomic, let us look at a few of Davidson's examples where I hope to show that not only does communication occur just the same, but that it occurrs precisely because we are allowed to set the bar arbitrarily.

In order to discuss partial translatability between conceptual schemes, Davidson introduces two languages: Plutonian and Saturnian.
The Plutonians can communicate with the Saturnians, though with difficulty, and the Saturnians can communicate with the Earthlings, but with difficulty, but Earthlings cannot communicate with Plutonians.
Davidson points out that in this scenario, the Earthlings cannot even recognize Plutonian language as language--and must take on faith that translating is actually what the Saturnians are doing.
Even so, he says, the Earthlings will have to consider the possibility that they have actually misunderstood that Saturnians. Put abstractly: if we embrace the notion of the relativity of conceptual schemes, then all languages become totally untranslatable if they are even partially untranslatable.

This result is a consequence of the way he has his analytic-synthetic knob set.
Since he thinks that the conceptual relativist wants to do away with synthetic truth altogether, Davidson paints a picturre where we can never be sure that we have understood what anybody says--after all, everybody's worlds differ somewhat.
But that just isn't how things are--we get by.
In this case, we follow 3. of the listener's code and let whatever the Saturnian says be synthetic.
To do anything else would be to contradict the first axiom that Davidson gave us for this excercise.


Quine (265):
Lacking access to people who speak a common tongue, Quine describes "radical translation" where the linguist has no choice but to improvise heavily.  Quine comes to the conclusion that, "the translator is bound to impose about as much as he discovers."
