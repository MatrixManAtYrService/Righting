A few years ago there was a string of very unlucky events that ultimately caused my roommate Lance to sustain a smattering of strokes.
Things got pretty bad there for a while--months were spent in the hostpital.
Then, his luck changed.
A drug that was designed to do something else entirely was discovered to be effective in his case.
Lance is a little bit different now, but considering what he has come back from he leads a remarkably normal life.

Let us consider two sentences: L := 'Lance is lucky' and ~L := 'Lance is not lucky` and ask which is true.
I think most people would admit that when it comes to the way we generally use language, the answer is "it depends."
Undocumented pharmacological effects don't usually show up to save the day--that they did in Lance's case makes him very lucky indeed.
On the other hand, what would be luckier still is to have never fallen ill in the first place.

In this paper I will sketch a theory within which we can make sense of the above two analyses.
Central to the theory is the notion of scope--it comes down to which beliefs get considered in our evaluation of Lance's luck, and which are taken for granted as just the way things are.
This theory will feel like a brand of relativism, and perhaps it is.

I have begun to suspect that relativism is a dirty word in epistemic circles.
Probably, the objections center around the way that relativism can provide a safe haven for irrationality.
Of what use are facts, one might ask, if anybody can make up their own?
