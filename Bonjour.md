In his article *The Coherence Theory of Empirical Knowledge* Lawrence Bonjour describes the Coherence Theory of Empirical Knowledge (hereafter CTEK) and defends it against against several criticisms that have been levied against theories like it.

In this preces I will summarize CTEK, I will describe one of the criticizms that Bonjour considers, and I will argue that Bonjour is successful in his defence against the selected criticizm.

In fact, I believe he is successful in all of his defenses in this article.

Bonjour makes it clear that his opponent in this article is the Foundationalist, he even mentions a potential weakness of CTEK, but declines to address it in depth because it would be equally damaging to the foundationalist's view.

With this in mind, I must admit that picking holes in CTEK from anything but a foundationalist perspective is potentially unfair.

On the other hand, if CTEK is to come into its own as a viable epistemological theory--it needs to also stand up to criticizms of a more diverse sort.

Following the analysis of Bonjour's defence, I offer such a criticizm.


At the heart of the distinction between foundationalism and coherentism is the regress problem, which goes like this:

Suppose that you believe that a certain proposition *p* is true, we will call your belief *B(p)*.

If I ask you to justify that belief, you might point out that *q* is true, and that *q => p*, which is why you believe *p*.

In response, I point out that your premises are also beliefs, and then ask that you justify *B(q)* and *B(q => p)*.

Of course I can now ask you to justify whatever other beliefs you invoke, and therein lies the problem.

If regress stops, what prevents me from asking for further justification to whatever reasons you gave most recently?

If regress doesn't stop, how can we feel justified in believing any of it?

The foundationalist holds that certain beliefs are special, and require no justification.

The coherentist (who holds the view that Bonjour defends) is happy to allow regress that continues indefinitely, so long as regress ultimately confines itself to a "coherent set," which is a set of beliefs that together form something that is justified [A].

[footnote A]: If the set of beliefs is finite and the regress is infite, this means that eventually one or more loops will form.



The special beliefs that foundationalists claim require no justification typically center on a person's contact with reality.

The arguments resemble this one: if I experience pain, I need no justification for that belief--the experience is sufficient.

Because of this, the foundationalist does not expect his beliefs to be wildly different from his peers--any two people must build their beliefs upon reality, he might argue, so they are guaranteed to have some common ground.
