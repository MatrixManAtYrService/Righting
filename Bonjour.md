In his article *The Coherence Theory of Empirical Knowledge* Lawrence Bonjour describes the Coherence Theory of Empirical Knowledge (hereafter CTEK) and defends it against against several criticisms that have been levied against theories like it.

In this preces I will summarize CTEK, I will describe one of the criticisms that Bonjour considers, and I will argue that Bonjour is successful in his defence against the selected criticism.

In fact, I believe he is successful in all of his defenses in this article.

Bonjour makes it clear that his opponent in this article is the Foundationalist, he even mentions a potential weakness of CTEK, but declines to address it in depth because it would be equally damaging to the foundationalist's view.

With this in mind, I must admit that picking holes in CTEK from anything but a foundationalist perspective is potentially unfair.

On the other hand, if CTEK is to come into its own as a viable epistemological theory (Bonjour indicates that the objections to it are considered by many to be too severe for it to be taken seriously), it needs to also stand up to criticisms of a more diverse sort.

Following the analysis of Bonjour's defence, I offer such a criticism.



Foundational beliefs typically center on a person's contact with reality.

The arguments resemble this one: if I experience pain, I need no justification for that belief--the experience is sufficient.

Because of this, the foundationalist does not expect his beliefs to be wildly different from his peers--any two people must build their beliefs upon reality, he might argue, so they are guaranteed to have at least some common ground.

Under CTEK, there are no foundational beliefs, so the foundationalist objects: 

"Coherence will never suffice to pick out one system of beliefs, since there will always be many other alternative incompatible systems of belief which are equally coherent and hence equally justified according to the CTEK" (Bonjour labels this objection I).

Bonjour handles this in two parts:

First is the possibility that at any moment, CTEK supports a multiplicity of coherent systems and provides no help for choosing between them.

Second is that even over time, as observation tunes the coherent system, there is no guarantee that the uncertainties of past moments will converge on a single worldview.



Bonjour points out of the first part, that this will be true of "any system of knowledge imaginable", and I would add that this portion of the foundationalists objection is called in simpler language "being uncertain."

The foundationalist asks: "which of these alternatives is true in my world?" and the coherentist asks: "which of these alternative worlds am I living in?" but this is actually the same question posed with a different linguistic slant.

The second part, Bonjour says, results from a misunderstanding of what really goes into forming the Coherent set in the first place.

It is not the case, as the foundationalist seems to think, that chains of justification wander unguided through the mind until they form a closed loop, and then magically become justified.

If this were the case, then indeed one might expect wildly different coherent sets to form for only trivially different sensations.



Instead, beliefs arise spontaneously, and are initially unjustified.

Eventually, correlations become noticable among the spontaneous beliefs.

This manifests as a belief itself--a belief that certain other beliefs can be expected to behave in certain ways.

At its core, this kind of belief resembles an inductive argument for the validity of induction:  

Regardless of the potentially awkward ground such an argument would rest on, one must admit that induction *does* work and that the only evidence we have for that belief is inductive.

This is pretty close to being the kind of self-justifying belief that coherentists are avoiding, but the difference is that it is an empirical belief--inferentially justified by the more particular beliefs that preceed it.

Once this process gets going, Bonjour argues that it is self-correcting.

So as long as a person is old enough to have developed a sufficiently featured landscape of justification, there is no concern that a new belief will have them spiraling off into who-knows-where in order to justify it--the necessary framework to justify it in a predictable way already exists.

That is, unless it is a black swan event--in which case the landscape may be called upon to change in order to both justify it and be prepared to use it to justify other beleifs.

It is this last feature of CTEK that Bonjour says will prevent two coherentists from coming to wildly different conclusions.





“There is no reason to think that one objective world will go on providing coherent input to incompatible systems in the long run,” Bonjour concludes before moving on to the next objection.  

This does not actually folllow from his formulation of CTEK.  

Here Bonjour takes two things for granted: (a) that the objective world is itself coherent and sufficiently accessable to expect that we can construct a similar coherence internally, and (b) that whatever process guides the formation of a coherent set does so without error or bias.

I claim that Bonjour is successful in his defence against the Foundationalist only because the foundationalist also takes (a) for granted, and is at least as suceptible to the dangers of (b) as the coherentist.

In fact, the foundationalist position is *more* in danger of forming an error-riddled worldview because his epistemic system doesn't offer any plan for correction should he find himself gone astray:

Denial, it would seem, is the only option.
