Dear Journal,

Nothing ever changes in the platonic realm, that's what we thought.
We wake up, we go to the office, we work all day, we come home, we go to bed, and the next day we do it all again.
We probably liked it that way.
But a few months ago, something did change.

A light appeared in the sky, brighter and stranger than anything jve ever seen.
Ji hardly managed to take two steps under it before a brilliant chaos entered jy mind.
Ji cannot put words to it except that it was so overwhelming--so utterly alien--that Ji had to close my eyes tightly and retreat back into jy house.
A few seconds longer beneith the light would have finished je off.
Whatever it is that ensues je that ji am J and not I or K would've been gone.

Ji can say for certain that ji'd never make it to the office if ji ventured out a second time.
So jive just been at home.
For *months*, hoping for the light to go away.
The periodicity of going to work is all that ji can remember--but now that ji have this extra time to explore Jim finding parts of my house that Ji never even knew existed.
Ji have a reading nook, can you believe it?
That's where ji found this journal.

Yesterday--as near as ji can tell since the light in the sky makes it hard to know where the sun is--ji found a telescope in jy attic.
With it, ji can see K's house from jy window.
And on the other side, ji can see I's house.

K's window was pulsing with the strange light from the sky.
It was dizzying to focus on at, but after a few tries ji discovered that it wasn't the window that was pulsing.
It was a mirror.
An apparatus made of broomsticks and rope--cantelevered out of K's upstairs windows--suspended the mirror next to K's house.
Ji couldn't see ker, but ji have to imagine that K was pulling ropes to manipulate the mirror.
K was signaling to je.

Ji watched it through jy telescope for as long as Ji could bear, then Ji would take a break
As soon as jy mind settled down ji would watch it some more.
Twenty six pulses, then a long pause.
Then one pulse, then a pause.
Then two pulses, then a pause.
The number of pulses increased steadily like this--with the pause getting shorter each time.
Then twenty six pulses again.
Finally, under the assumption that ji had figured out that one pulse was for 'A' and twenty six was for 'Z', the message began.

'R'. 'E'. 'S'. 'P'. 'O'. 'N'. 'D'.

Then K would take a break, after which ke would send the message again.
I's house showed nothing of the sort.
It took je two days to cobble together a similar system.
