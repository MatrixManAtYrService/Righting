# Proof Of Forum (a blockchain thing): The Tip of a Philosophical Iceburg

What if money fails us, and then traditional political powers fail to do anything about it?
Here's a comment I found that describes what such a thing might look like:

>  Ultimately the people who own all the capital won’t need anyone else to survive. They’ll build walls and robot guards and live in their utopias of plenty while everyone else starves.

I'm not interested in making predictions, so I won't dwell on the likelihood of this.
I'm interested in solving problems--so instead I'll assume that something like this is possible, and I'll just focus on proposing a solution.

## Old Money, New Money

The purpose of money is to be circulated and facilitate exchange.
If money ultimately motivates people to consistently keep it behind walls with robot guards, then it is has failed to achieve that pupose.
So the solution is to replace it with something that doesn't have that problem.
Once the replacement proves its stability, we can stop valuing the original money.
We'll see who is worried about starving then.

Of course nobody need actually starve.
If the farmers, wall-fixers, and guard-robot-reparers take payment in new-money, and the old-rich still have access to previously withheld resources, then all they need to do to is use it to provide goods and services in exchange for new-money, which they can then spend on food, walls, and maintenance for their robot guards, or whatever.
That is to say, the existence of an alternate money will destabilize the centralization of power in cases where that centralization becomes too extreme.
How extreme is "too extreme" comes down to how bad things have to get before the masses are willing to abandon old-money in order to regain bargaining power.
This is only a stable solution, however, if the new money is somehow more resistant to centralization than the old money.

We've seen many more alternatives to money in the last decade than we ever have before.
Many see them as "investments", and attempt to use them as a way to gain access to more old-money.
Personally, I hope that these endeavors fail, and that people with those aims end up with less old-money than they started with.
Some (myself at least) see them as investments of a different sort.
By storing some of my wealth in cryptocurrency, I am contributing to the diversity of available monetary systems.
If those in power get too feisty, having those monetary systems around is going to be handy, as I have illustrated above.

## Proof of Work

The majority of cryptocurrencies available today fall into two categories:

- Proof-of-work
- Proof-of-stake

Bitcoin is a well known proof of work currency.
It relies on the scarcity of computational power to ensure that its tokens behave, more or less, like old-money.
Changes to the bitcoin protocol are only going to happen if the people who control the computational power that the currency relies in (i.e. miners) want those changes to happen.
Proof-of-work has some cool properties (for example, you can use the length of the blockchain kind of like a clock which certain mathematical constrants prevent from running too fast), so I don't think it's going away.
On the other hand, having access to hardware that is good at calculating partial collisions of cryptographic hashes is _not_ the kind of thing I look for when I'm chosing people who will have political power over me (and deciding how money should work counts as political power).

The quality I am after here is has to do with the extent to which a currency puts political power in the hands of people who aren't incentivized to use it fairly.
From this perspective, proof-of-work currencies are even worse than old-money.
At least with old-money, we can consider that the allocation of power might have something to do with merit, and might have been influenced by choices we made (e.g. elections).
With proof-of-work, this power is in the hands of whoever thought to buy the right trinkets at the right time.
I have some respect for folk who are savvy in this way, but not so much respect that I think that their market savvyness makes them worthy political leaders.

For this reason, I don't think any proof-of-work protocol is going to be the new-money I'm looking to invest in.
If I store my wealth in a proof-of-work coin, there's no reason to believe that those in power (i.e. the ones I want to disencentivize from building walls and robot guards) won't find a way to control the computational resources that it relies on, and in doing so prevent any changes that threaten the status-quo.
Now let's look at proof of stake.

## Proof of Stake

In proof-of-stake currencies, people who have lots of coin act as arbiters over transactions involving smaller amounts.
To do so, they risk losing their coin, and if they are later determined to have behaved honestly, they get the risked amount back, plus a reward.
From an electricity consumption perspective, this is a much more efficient system.
It also appears to be more a more flexible system, because each coin can have a different perspective on what "behaving honestly" means.

I'm excited about proof-of-stake currencies for two reasons.
First, they incentivize people to hold a stake in a currency, and it seems likely that currency designers will find a way to increase the reward for staking in cases where a participant has been staking for a long time.
This will ultimately have a dampening effect on price volatility, which is currently one of the barriers to existing cryptocurrencies being new-money.
Second, just like proof-of-work caused an uptick in demand for massively parallel computing (which I suspect will have had an accelerating effect on the development of certain machine learning techniques), I expect that proof-of-stake will cause an increased interest in game-theoretically-sound policy design.

Lots of systems we use involve an external authority which enforces the rules (just think of the IRS, which will punish you if you don't pay your taxes).
Proof-of-work uses traits of probability and silicon to enforce its rules--traits which we have discovered do the trick, but for which nobody can take take credit for having designed.
Proof-of-stake, on the other hand, requires careful thought about what motivates people.
Rather than using an authority, or a trick of math to prevent people from cheating, proof-of-stake structures the game so that cheaters never come out ahead, so they have no reason to do so.
Even if we don't end up using a proof-of-stake coin to moderate commerce, I think the research that goes into their design will show up in other places, and that we'll probably be happy about the influence it had.

But proof-of-stake has the same problem that old-money has.
It is the people who already have the money that get to make decisions about changes to the currency--changes that will ultimately impact the ways that money flows among the people.
Admittedly, it is a _little_ better than old-money, because switching from one cryptocurrency to another is easier than switching from something like the dollar to something like bitcoin.
One switch requires a cultural retraining of daunting scope, the other requires a software update.
The death of old money, if it becomes necessary, will probably be slow and uncomfortable.
On the other hand, if a group of proof-of-stake elites begins behaving in ways that don't serve the people, then we, the people, can just employ the same strategy against them as I proposed above.
This ought to keep the power concentrated in the hands of the most benevolent elites available--but I expect it will still concentrate in similar distributions as old money.
We can do better.

## Proof of Forum

In order to protect the tradeworthyness of a currency, the creation of its tokens must rely on something scarce.
Otherwise, no matter how many tokens exist, a greedy individual could easily generate more than that--no token with this property could hold value for long.
In proof of work, this is clock cycles.
In proof of stake, this is the tokens of the currency themselves.
I think it's interesting that we say "time is money," and both prevailing paradigms are time centric.
That is, it's either about how many operations you can perform in a second, or it's about allocating funds for staking for as many seconds as possible.

Proof of forum also relies on time, but in this case it comes down to the participant's ability to congregate with other participants for a predetermined block of seconds.
I call these meetings forums.
I have a few ideas about what people might do at a forum, but the only important thing is that they not also be at some other forum too.

If a participant were able to sneakily participate in two forums at onces, that participant would be paid twice, while other participants only get paid once.
This should be easy enough to enforce--since they're in the same room, they can use their own device to certify each other's participation to the network.
It is also pretty easy to understand why it ought to be enforced.
Just as no voter wants any other voter to vote twice, so too should no forum participant want anyone else to split their attentions and double their reward.

There are a few other constraints that I would add to such a currency, although they aren't strictly related to its proof-of-forumness:

- To encourage people to maintain a consistent identity, but still allow the occasional failure to attend, forum participants only get paid if they have participated in some ratio of the preceeding forums.
- To encourage exchange instead of long-term savings, all wallet ballances decrease by some ratio every time a forum is held.
- To prevent entire forums from cheating (by holding two forums with the same set of people), the protocol will reduce payouts for forums that are too similar in membership to any previous ones.

## An Example

Let us imagine a proof-of-forum currency which has a 2000 second forum, with attendence from 6 - 12 people, every 2000000 seconds.
That is, participants are asked to get together for a half-hour in groups of 6-12 once every 23 days or so.
Given the last three forums, if two or three were attended, then the current one pays 100 tokens, otherwise the current one pays 10 tokens.
Wallet sizes are reduced by 10% every time a forum happens, regardless of whether the wallet holder participates.

Here's some code:

    def forum(num):
        return (num * 0.9) + 100

    value = 0

    for i in range(50):
        print(i, ':', value)
        value = forum(value)

And here's its output:

    0 : 0
    1 : 100.0
    2 : 190.0
    3 : 271.0
    4 : 343.9

    ... forums 5 - 46 omitted...

    47 : 992.9303495098491
    48 : 993.6373145588642
    49 : 994.2735831029778

As you can see, an empty wallet fills quickly, but a full wallet fills slowly.
If we start with more than 1000 tokens in the wallet, the net value reduces over time towards 1000--even if we participate in every forum.
Patience, with this kind of token, is not going to get you rich--that's the point.
There's no sense saving up for walls and robot guards--if you want more than 1000 tokens, you'll have to find some way to be actually (and continually) useful to other participants.

I excluded the 10-token newcomer reward from the example above to keep the code simple.
It exists primarily to give new participants a chance to become familiar with exchanging tokens while still also being a small enough sum to discourage them from frequently recycling identities.
Further constraints may depend on this number as well.

A few more constraints that I would add if I were building this:

 - The only way to get a new wallet is to attend a forum and have somebody who is allowed to make wallets make one for you.
 - In order to create a wallet you must:
   - Currently be attending a forum
   - Have received a forum payout of 100 tokens in two of the last three forums
   - Not have created any other wallets during that forum (i.e. you can only create one wallet per forum)

These constrants exist to limit the rate of adoption.
The idea is that if we limit the influx of new participants, old participants will have to be selective (at first) about who they invite.
Ideally, by the time a new invitee is able to themselves invite people they will have invested enough time (at lest 12000000 seconds in this case) and derived enough value (by exchanging the tokens for goods and services), and met enough people that are similarly deriving value, that they feel they have something to lose.
Hopefully, this will prevent people from participating in attacks that would weaken the value of the currency, since they now have a stake in it.

These rules were designed to make attacks difficult, but they will not be impossible.
As we will see in the next section, it may become necessary for communities of forumgoers to police themselves for bad behavior.
Small communities that were grown slowly are more likely to be densely connected (as in, two members chosen at random are more likely to know each other) than ones that grew too fast.
This level of connectedness will make that policing easier.

To support a final constraint, we expect that the network will keep a record of all fora, their participants, and their payout sizes.
Now we'll make a small modification to the payout size:
 - 10 - 2n tokens if you havent' participated in two of the last three fora
 - 100/(_n_^2 + 1) tokens if you have participated in two of the last three fora
In the formulae above, _n_ is the number of times you've had forum with the current set of participants.

So as long as you never meet with the same group twice your payouts will go: 10, 10, 100, 100, 100...
But if you always meet with the same group it will go: 10, 8, 20, 10, 5.9, 3.8...
This encourages diversity within fora, and also limits the profitability of certain kinds of attacks.

I'm not trying to pitch this particular example as a currency you should participate in.
It probably needs some work before it's ready to be implemented.
It is sufficient, however, to describe the kind of dynamics that I expect to emerge around any proof-of-forum currency.
Later I will describe a possible attack on it and discuss avenues towards mitigating them.
But first, I'd like to describe how I expect that people could ever come to value tokens of this sort.


## Economic Domains

In this section I will describe two problems that I faced recently, they are problems that would be easier to address if I lived in a community with a functioning proof-of-forum token.
The first problem has to do with coming up with a price for tutorig:
A friend of a friend has a daughter who is struggling with math.
It was proposed that maybe I could tutor this girl: "we don't have very much money," her parent said to me, "but we can manage to pay you something for your time."

I want to be a math teacher when I grow up, but for now I'm an engineer--it is work that demands a bit more time than I'd like, but it pays well.
There are two simple ways to come up with a price for my tutoring services.
I could see what the normal hourly rate is for a tutor with my credentials, and decide if I'm willing to work for that.
Or I could look at my salary, convert it to an hourly rate, and demnd that since the labor market says it's "what my time is worth".

Neither strategy would set a price that was low enough that I would feel comfortable accepting it, given my understanding of her parents' financials.
Nor would either strategy come up with a price that would motivate me extrinsically--if I did this, it would be because I derive some intrinsic value from it.
On the other hand, I didn't want to do it for free because I wanted her to have an incentive to come prepared so that we could be as efficient as possible.
I want students that are willing to put in the work beforehand so that we can maxmize learning while together, not a homework buddy.

This brings to questions to mind:

 - What is my time worth when I am working for The Man--a corporate entity that I don't think cares one bit about my community?
 - What is my time worth when I am working to support my community--a group of people that I may one day need support from as well?

Is it really useful to express both answers in the same currency?
I think not.
If we try, things stop making sense pretty quickly.
Suppose I decide that spending the time supporting my community in this way is worth $20/hr--that is, I would pay $20 or less to have somebody else provide the same support so that I could instead do something else for an hour.
As soon as I have this number I have to rethink it, because I would prefer to live in a community where somebody who needs math help doesn't need to cough up $20, so should I really be demanding $20?
Also, if I were to pay somebody to do this for me--then I'd have to question the extent to which the affected community is really mine, given that in this scenario I've hired someone to be a buffer between myself and it.
Further, if that's how I feel, why bother being a math teacher at all?
As an engineer I ought to be able to pay two other people to do that job.

My other attempts to reconcile these notions through a single measure of value have also converged on some kind of moral sacrifice on my part.
If I let The Man's tokens be my measurement of value, I find myself working against my community in order to get the money that I might later use to support that community.
It feels like a trap closing over me--like the unrelenting logic of single token evaluation has somehow tricked me into adopting a value system that I hate.
That's a road for me to travel a different day, for now my point is this:
I have yet to find a way to use the value of a single token to bring the two questions above in context with each other in a way that I find morally palatable.
Until I do, I'll continue working under the assumption that they are best evaluated in separate ecomonic domains.

My ideal compensation for tutoring would be something other than money--then it wouldn't be tainted by the various moral considerations above.
For example, I'd love to have the work of some local artist up on my walls.
And when people commented on it I'd like to be able to explain how I received the artwork in exchange for the teaching.
But my student isn't an artist.
Whatever her ability to contribute to her community, it isn't particularly compatible with what I'd currentlly like to receive.

A proof-of-forum token would solve this.
Because every active participant in a forum receives the same pay, I wouldn't have to worry about the income difference--in this smaller economic domain, we're equals.
Additionally, I wouldn't have encouraged anybody to spend any additinal hours working for The Man (who I distrust), so I can feel good about that too.
With the extra tokens, I can find a local artist and buy the art that I want on my walls and still feel like I have earned it from my community by contributing directly to that community.

The second example involves a friend who works in an IT department.
His company recently upgraded their laptops, so he is in charge of ensuring that the old ones are recycled.
In this case, "recycling" means paying some company to take them away, test them, and either resell them, resell their parts, or find environmentally responsible ways to dispose of them.
As the IT guy, my friend knows that they're in perfect condition--nobody need bother with all of that testing and sorting, they can just be put directly to use.
Giving them to the recycler would require the IT department to pay more, only to create needless work for somebody else.

Conversations with my friends' boss indicate that there's no problem with him donating them to a local school (provided that the IT department wasn't on the hook for support in any way), but that the higher-ups would probably be uncomfortable if he started selling them on e-bay.
Income of that sort would have to go through the appropriate bookkeeping channels, and it wouldn't be enough money that it would be worth the administrative overhead.
The trouble is, the local school district has enough buearocracy of its own that it can't just take delivery of a bunch of free laptops, despite the fact that they're far superior to the ones currently in use.
We're probably going to have essay competitions and give them directly to the students--but should we have to be so creative?

If we want to contribute something of value to the community in a way that doesn't taint it with the politics of doing business with old money, we should be able to do so relatively easily.
If our community had a proof-of-forum token, we could sell the laptops to the community on behalf of the IT department.
No dollars coming in would mean no extra administrative overhead.
The IT department could then invest the tokens back into the community with out allegations of misconduct (provided the community tokens don't count as money).
Following this, the IT department could use those tokens to further give back to the community--for example they could contribute towards the construction of a nearby skate park near the office.
Maybe this would prevent kids from skateboaring in the receiving area, and prevent the need to hire additional security staff.

I don't know how it would actually work out, but the point is that through cross-domain reasoning it may be possible to find efficiencies in one or both domains that weren't accessable otherwise.
In this second example members of the community would get access to technology without having to pay the extra costs incurred by the multitude of middle-men involved in turning the laptops from "recycled" into "sold"--so people operating in the smaller economic domain benefitted.
Also, by allowing participating in the smaller economic domain to remain unfettered by the overhead of the larger one, the company was able to acheive savings in terms of the larger-domain token in ways that would have been politically prohibitive if done through normal means--and at no point was it necessary to determine a value equivalence between the tokens.

## Equivalences, Intrinsic and Occasional

The economic domains introduced in the previous section are a specific case of something much more general.
In mathematics we would call them metric spaces, but for consistency's sake I will call them value domains.

A value domain is someplace where you can use concepts like "more" and "less" to come up with a number that expresses something.
This morning, I inflated my bicycle tires to 35 PSI before riding to work.
I had some options, I could have chosen 10 PSI, or 50, but for some external, non-numeric, reason I chose 35.
Bike tire pressure, as measured in PSI, is an example of a value domain.

That external reason had to do with the fact that my path to work isn't very bumpy.
When I go mountain biking, I usually shoot for more like 20 PSI.
Path bumpyness, if we worked at it, could be made into a value domain as well--perhaps my path to work gets a 2, and my favorite trail gets a 12 on some scale where higher numbers mean bumpier paths.

Much of the reasoning we do with numbers works this way--by taking two or more value-domains and establishing correspondences betwen them.
I maximize my comfort level (a third value domain) by selecting a point in the tire-pressure value domain as a function of the value of a point in the path-bumpyness domain.
Lots of domains may appear to be different in some superficial way(tire pressure in PSI, tire pressure in Atm, tire pressure in kPa), but we find that if we switch between them the only thing that changes are the numbers--the actual decisions made are the same.

Economic domains typically work this way too.
You can buy something with USD or EUR, but at least according conventional economic thought you'd still have to do the same amount of work to earn enough money for the purchase.
So deep down, we typically pretend that there's only just one economic domain, and that the currency-differences can be pretty much ignored for most decisions.

The example I gave earlier (which I will start calling an "elliptic" curency for reasons that will become clear shortly) is a challenge to the idea that all economic domains are ultimately equivalent.
In that example, all wallets asymptotically approach the same value over time (assuming no spending and consistent forum participation).
If we take an econimic decision that used something like USD (a "flat" currency) to mediate an equivalence between value domains, and we substitute an elliptic currency, we find that the reasoning we are used to no longer makes sense.
Saving a small amount for a long time, for example, is a fine way to achieve a large account balance in a flat currency, but it may not get you there at all in an elliptic currency.
In other words, value in a flat currency is Archimedean, while value in an elliptic currency is not.

Plenty of other value domains work this way.
For example, the tire-pressure domain is also non-Archimedean.
Sure, if I want 45 PSI, and my pump only adds 1 PSI at once I can get there from 0 with some patience, but if I want 450 PSI, no amount of pumping will get me there (my tire will burst instead).
Despite these complexities, we manage to identify favorable correspondences across non-equivalent domans, and there's no reason we couldn't do the same for economic ones as well.

I have not yet developed the mathematical formalism to support this analogy, but I like to think of elliptic currencies like ways to draw lines on a sphere (which is a type of elliptic geometry), and flat ones as ways to shine laser beams through an empty space (a euclidean geometry).
In the case of laser beams, you can offset one beam from another, and as long as they are aimed correctly, they'll never intersect.
This isn't the case for lines on a sphere, every line you put out there on a sphere wraps around and comes back at you.

Before we take this metaphor back to currencies, consider that value domains often come with some kind of attached logic.
Just like how I know not to inflate my bike tire to 450 PSI, I also know that there is a certain sort of behavior that a flat currency "wants" me to conform to.
(I'm writing this because I refuse that call).
According to the logic of flat currencies, I am supposed to think in terms of extremes:
If I'm a seller, something is worth as much as I can get for it, and if I'm a buyer it's worth as little as I have to pay to get it.
No part of this logic makes any reference to an actual, intrinsic, value of the item--it's all about varying degrees of success when it comes to exploiting other participants.
Another thing that flat-currency logic doesn't address is that perhaps I don't want to live in a community where everybody is trying to exploit me all the time.
I may dislike the exploitation so much, that I would even be willing to moderate my own behavior to be less exploitive of others.

This is the property that makes elliptic currencies elliptic.
The logic of flat currencies, much like that of playing with lasers in a place with no mirrors, assumes that you always have enough space.
When reasoning in such a space, one needn't think about how their actions might influence the world in ways that they'll later have to contend with.
Those actions will never wrap around and get them in the back.

Elliptic currencies, however, are built around that idea.





## Value-based vs Values-based Decisions





## Parasites

Here we will describe an attack on the example described above.
You'll need a lack of scrouples, two friends that are similarly inclined, losts of time, and a community to attack that doesn't bother policing for your sort.

1. Convince someone who can make wallets to invite you to a forum and make you a wallet, have your friends to the same.
2. Attend forums until you and your friends are allowed to make new wallets
3. Hold a forum with your friends and create wallets for people who don't actually exist
4. Continue to hold forums and create wallets with only your friends and the fake participants you created
5. Collect the payouts from the "pocket forums" you and your friends have created

Another way to get this done is to use some other means (external currency, device tamering, or violence) to gain control of three identities that can create wallets, then you can get down to the business of profiting from pocket fora immediately.

The possibility of attacks like this is what makes it advisable to grow the network slowly.
If a community of forumgoers is closely connected (as in, the we-saw-each-other-at-a-forum-recently relationship is likely to overlap with the we-say-hi-when-crossing-paths relationship), then
