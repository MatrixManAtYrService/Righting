# An Appeal to the Next Altarweaver

The document in the section that follows is a draft.

Scuzzi Disdreaderr has kept one version of it or another close at hand for the last several years.
He has traveled to the surface looking for an answer to a riddle posed to him by Garl Glittergold.
It is a riddle that derailed his ascention into the clergy of the deity he was trained to worship and marked him as an outsider in his own home.
He searches still.

He believes that he must repair an ancient work of magic that is far beyond his skill.
It is the kind of belief that no sane Sverfneblin would cultivate among their own people.

He believes that he was tricked out of that mindset so that he could find a new one in the wider world.
He ultimately plans to return home and use it to protect his people's innocence, with or without their help.

He still hopes to find someone with sufficient skill.
He keeps rewriting it so that he will know what to say if he ever finds the Altarweaver that he seeks.
But he's beginning to lose hope.
Perhaps the world no longer makes people that are skillful enough to reweave the Altar, and yet wise enough to separate that act from their quest for personal power.

## The Appeal

A child sees the world as it is, oblivious to any other way.
Then he becomes a young man and is swept up in the current of his times.
If he later endeavors to sit still for long enough to again see it afresh, he will need more stillness than he has time for.

A druid of the surface forest might spend a lifetime learning its sounds and smells.
She patiently inches closer, year by year, to a peace whence she can call the bear "friend".
But despite her dedication she'll never know the trees like the Dryad knows them from birth.

Such is the relationship between the somber svirfnebli acolytes of Callarduran Smoothands and the playful pech deep druids of The Gemscape (or the "Quasi-Elemental Plane of Minerals" as it is called by your people).
Our most sacred rite of communion with the earth, reserved only for the most dedicated-- it is like learning to walk for the blessed children of the pech.
But I'm getting ahead of myself.

Whatever you might know of the pech, know that you've learned it from their exiles.
Their homeland is a place altogether different than this one, a place that we could not survive any more than the majority of them could survive here.
Each pech that lives in the material plane can trace their lineage to some blasphemer who took that dreadful step out of the stone and into the air and not only survived it, but for whatever reason didn't immediately turn back.
If there are druids among these, I know them not.

I know of the pech homeland because for a brief moment I was a pech druid.
In that moment, I can only imagine that that druid was also me, but who can say?
Such is the one aspect of the Focus.

Just as a loop of fabric must have a place where it was sown together, so too must every plane share a Focus with at least one other plane (usually several).
It's hard to say if it moves around, or if this world moves around it, but tethered near the main altar in your "Wave Echo Cave" is a remarkable patch of space.

Think of it like the point in a growing whirlpool that plunges downward away from the surface around it.
Or perpaps its the eye of a storm in which a flash of lightning lasts for centuries.
Or perhaps it's the material plane's belly button.
In relation to the neighboring planes, it's some kind of between-place, and it's fundamental to the elemental energies that hold our world together.

For the svirfnebli, it is a place for listening to the earth.
Although in my case, the earth would not speak--perhaps because my druid friend was on the other side instead.
I know the things I do because as I lay on the altar and let the focus center on my mind, the druid lay also in stillness on his side.
I know these things because he knew them.

The focus is far older than the cavern.
For ages it drifted through the solid rock of our world unobserved except by fleeting accident.
During one such accident, the mind that it brushed--and what a mind it must have been--recognized it quickly enough to act.
Altarweaver used the Focus' privileged position amid the latent elemental energies to weave the cavern around it.

It's not just a hole in the rock though.
No amount of excavation from the top or sides would ever create a new entrance to the wave echo cave because it's not squarely in material space.
You'd call it a demiplane if it was fully detached, but instead it's like a the drawstrings of bag of holding embedded in the rock.
A narrow umbilicus connects it to the material plane from below.

The "wave echo" that you hear near the entrance is the surface tension of the material plane trying to flatten the anomaly.
That tension is balanced expertly against the flux of elemental energy that is mediated by the Focus.
When Altarweaver established that balance, they did so with a skill that transcends any I have known.
It was not an act of strength--the focus provides both place-to-stand and long-enough-lever.
One needn't be strong to use it, but to have situated the cavern around it so that the configuration remains stable for hundreds of years was a work of great skill and understanding.
And it must have been done on our side of the focus.

For ages it has been a hidden place, known to only those deemed sensible enough to be invited by others.
All references to it that I've been able to find have marked it as a holy place--a place for quiet communion with energies that extend far beyond our pocket of the universe.
And in at least one case, communion with minds from beyond as well.

If you wanted to meddle in planar travel, you'd do it from the Focus.
If you wanted to listen in on tendrils of prayer, thought properly private and branching out to divine domains elsewhere, you'd do it from the Focus.
If you wanted to pick at the corners of this world and see what mischeif pops out when they start to peel back, I can think of no better place to start from than the focus.
There is great danger in letting this place fall into evil hands.
I am especially distrustful of whichever culture came up with the term "Spell Forge" for the Focus.

My people don't have the imagination for such deeds.
We've our own sort of cleverness to be sure, but it doesn't call us to quests like mine.
We're content to pilgrimage, and to listen, and to worship--as are all who have been shown the secret to the cave's entrance.
Perhaps I no longer have a right to the place, now that I'm treating it like anything other than a gift.
I spent many years away from home to realize that the Focus was something that needed protecting, but I'm convinced that it does, so I've come back.

If the way is clear for anyone to just "find" the Focus, and it seems that it is, then a new Altarweaver must be found.
The place must be untethered from its current spot in the earth and re-anchored elsewhere, and with new safeguards set.

My people will never forgive me for wrenching their mecca from its place at the end of their pilgrimage, and who knows what strife this will cause the others that know and respect the place, but it must be done.

## The Secret Bits

Scuzzi has withheld several things from his candidate Altarweaver.

1. Once he searches an archive for hints about the Focus--more as a way of learning who in town might understand it--he destroys those documents to prevent others from finding the cavern.

2. He believes that the careful balance that maintains the entrance to the cave's interface with the material plane is a trap.  If too much power is harnessed from the Focus at once, it will destabilize the integrity of the interface and the whole cavern will separate from the material plane, collapsing into a demiplane with no connections to anywhere.  The holy site will be lost, but at least it won't fall into the wrong hands.  Subsequently, a new focus will form deep in the earth, probably not to be found for a very long time.

3. If he can't restore the secrecy of the cavern, he'll spring the trap before a sufficiently advanced enemy can disarm it

## Magic in the cavern

None of the stone around here is carved, it's like the whole place was made by a glassblower out of a single chunk of volcanic glass.  Even the altar and the benches and the other things that would typically be man made are extruded from the floor or walls.  These smooth surfaces reflect misfired spells.

The Focus will always be within 30 feet of the main altar, it was tethered there by the first Altarweaver and roams around that space more or less at random.  A successful arcana check is required to discern its location.  It moves at the pace of a leisurely stroll.

If a ranged spell is cast towards the focus, it travels half as far as intended--as if it were traveling upstream.  In order to hit their target the caster must have puzzled out the range problem and adjusted accordingly.  Similarly, ranged spells have their distance doubled if they are cast away from the Focus, as if the magic is traveling downstream.  A 60 foot ranged spell has a range of 120 feet in this direction, but is likely to overshoot on a first try.  Spells cast along a tangent to a circle centered on the focus will curve away from the focus for the first half of their travel, and then along a ray anchored at the focus for the second half of their travel, as if they were swept up in the stream that emanates from the focus in all directions.

Spells that would have their distance elongated by the altered space (i.e. with the caster's back to the focus) deal extra damage or have more potent affects.  Spells that travel "upstream" towards the focus have reduced damage or have weaker effects.
Also, it gets easier to discern the Focus's location (and therefore retarget your spells appropriately) if you're closer to it.

I guess it's kind of set up for a "King of the hill" situation where whoever is nearest the focus has a good chance of defending it, if they understand the area.  But we don't want it to make sense to eschew magic to avoid subsequent mayhem, so...

Spells that miss due to these rules don't burn spell slots.
Spells that hit "maybe" burn spell slots.
If you're closer to the focus, you have a higher probability of getting to reuse that slot even when your spell hits.
Perhaps a failed save against your spellcasting modifier causes you to expend the slot, offset by some value to account for distance?  Perhaps the DC is +3 at 100 feet, unmodified at 60 feet, and -3 within 30 feet?

Lastly, if someone finds a way to exploit the altered rules of the place to draw too much power in too short of a time, they destabilize the interface with the material plane and the cave becomes a quesionably stable demiplane where we're likely trapped forever--that is unless they figure out how to remove the bottleneck first.  Then we've given the bad guy a really big gun.

Scuzzi is overly worried about that last outcome, and will probably sacrifice himself and anyone in the chamber to prevent it.  Even if it means prematurely and permanently destabilizing the exit.
