An Informal Criticism of a Potential Topological Metatheory for Formal Criticism

We(1) shall begin by taking two additional axioms here that will allow me to avoid belaboring the reader with justifications and arguments that might distract from the task at hand.  Axiom 1: Mathematics is an art.  Axiom 2: Arts benefit from criticism.  Ok, as long as you're cool with syllogisms, the first theorem is easy: Mathematics benefits from criticism.  Well, there you have it.  That's my theory.  It's called "Introductory Theory," or IT for short.  What do you think?

I hope you agree that despite being logically sound, IT is unsatisfying in a number of ways.  Theories ought to be useful for answering "why" questions.  They should make it easy to determine when they are applicable, and in such cases they should aide in the discovery of new facts about their domains.  IT does none of these things.  Ok, so it's pretty bad, but is it the worst possible theory?  Well, it certainly fails the above criteria, but in order to be better or worse than some other theory there would need to be some way of understanding their merits relative to one another.  That is, there would need to be a theory for evaluating the suitibility of other theories--a metatheory for mathematical criticism.  In this paper, I will present a sketch of a metatheory that could meet these needs; we can call it a Topological Metatheory for Mathematical Criticism (or TMMC).  We will evaluate TMMC in a way that is similar to the ad hoc methods used above against IT.  If it passes muster, perhaps future work can be done to complete TMMC, and then it can later be used to evaluate itself in a more thorough fashion, though no attempt will be made here to begin that kind of analysis.

Before describing TMMC, I would like to briefly go over one more example theory, S, which consists of a single axiom: "Each person is between two other people."  This is a much better theory.  It is immediately clear that it applies to arrangements of people, so I will not waste time using it to understand the clutter on my desk.  One can easily imagine scenarios where it is a model (people standing in a circle of any size, an infinite line of people, etc), and where it is not (e.g. one guy, all alone).  S also helps us discover new facts about a particular scenario that it is a model for.  Is it possible for everybody to hold hands?  As long as these people are shaped how we expect (two hands each, on opposite sides, etc), S leads us to believe that the answer is yes.

One metric I would like to introduce is that of a theory's *power* when applied to a model.  Consider the following model for S: Six people arranged in a hexagon, some sitting, some standing.  In this case, S is underpowered in the model because there are relatively many facts about the model--such as how many people there are or which are sitting and which are standing--that S cannot help with.  In general, this is not a failing of S, underpowered theories are useful because they are likely to be applicable towards other models.  But it *could* be a problem if you were planning to use S to talk about how many people are in the model.

It is my humble oppinion that real analysis (the mathematical theory) has overpowered the real numbers (which are a model for that theory).  By this I mean that whichever model might be said to have inspired real analysis, i.e. objects with infinitely divisible absolute value, was required to take on new characteristics to accomodate the theory (3)(4).  The characteristic that comes to mind for me is the fact that there are infinitely more noncomputable numbers than there are computable numbers.  This means that every number can know the value of has been something of a freak, a wildly improbable outlier in a sea of "normal" real numbers, all of which we have no access to.  This strikes me as the kind of characteristic of the reals that we had to accept because our theory demanded it, not something that we were shooting for when we built the theory(5).  Another example of this overpowering can be found in the Banach-Tarski paradox (which is the one where one sphere is dissasembled and reassembled into two spheres of equal size).  Again, this is not a failing of real analysis or of the real numbers, it is just a facet of the pairing that might be good (if you're interested in exploring unintuitive facts about the reals) or it might be bad (if you want the simplest way to understand why calculus works(6)(7).

The typical case for TMMC would have us applying it to a particular model-theory pair.  So maybe our model is the theory of real analysis together with the real numbers, and then TMMC can be the theory we use to study the properties of that pairing.  Or maybe our model is the theory of quantum mechanics together with the corpus of relevant experimental results, and then again TMMC can hopefully give us some perspective there too (8) .  For any of this to work, our chosen pair must be a model for the TMMC.  More specifically, since TMMC uses topological concepts to study the pairings, both the theory and the model must be able to be conceived of as topological spaces.  Rather than check each theory-model-pair, we will construct a topological space out of a set containing all theories, and out of a set containing all models.  This way, a particular theory-model-pair can show up as a pair of subspace topologies.

We shall start with theory space (Th).  Let T be a set of propositions(9) and let h be a topology on T.   where each open set (P) have this property: elements of P are either themselves axioms, or can be proven from other axioms in P.  So any h-open set either consists of all axioms, or it contains, through the application of logic rules to axioms, some nugget of reasoning.  As it stands, Th is the discrete topology, since you could show that any set of propositions is open by just taking every one of them to be an axiom.  We shall soon add a restriction about when a proposition can be taken as an axiom make Th topologically more interesting, but first we need to know two things:  When are two propositions equal?  How can we tell when a proposition is to be treated as an axiom?

Once a theorem is proved in mathematics, we generally do not refer to it by its proof, but only by some string of symbols that we understand *could* be proved.  This allows us to simplify things by taking that string of symbols as an axiom, and only bothering to expand it into a proof if pressed to do so by a skeptic.  This potential for expansion represents an oportunity to transform a small Th-open set with a couple dubious axioms into a larger Th-open set with different axioms that are (hopefully) more agreeable to the audience.  We shall call this process *proof-substitution*(10), it is a facet of argumentation that we wish to preserve, and in order to do so we cannot have any ambiguity about *which* proof a given string of symbols ought to be expanded to.  Because of this, we shall take two propositions to be equal when they have the same proof.

It may seem that we have swept something under the rug here, because now we need to know what a proof is.  But notice that our open sets here provide a very specific context in which to find a proof for a theorem.  They provide a neighboring set of propositions and a guarantee (i.e. provability) that the chosen proposition can be traced back to axioms.  That is to say, our open sets are themselves proofs, so the proof to consider when determining proposition equality is (at least for starters) the one that is indicated in the open set that contains the point.  A diagram may be helpful here.

[ Proposition Graph goes here]

Let A = { 8, 9, 10 }
Let B = { 1, 8, 9, 10, 11 }

First note that if you take 8 and 9 as axioms then 10 is provable, and if you take 1, 8, and 9 as axioms then both 10 and 11 are provable, so A and B are Th-open sets.  So far, we have described proposition equality in terms of the neighborhoods of those propositions.  The reader may be at this point concerned about circularity: If a point's identity is defined based on what set it is in, can you still define a set based on what points are in it?  Well, on the surface, probably not, but this is where the process of proof-substitution discussed previously comes in.  As an example, let us prove that proposition 10 is indeed equal to itself.

The set A 






[1] That is to say, "You and I."  You, because in order for us to communicate at all we must first come to terms with each other--that is, agree upon some axioms, and I because these these are the axioms I have chosen for what I want to communicate.  It is common to adopt the "we" voice while making a mathematical argument.  I must admit there is a possibility that this convention came about while imitating proofs that appear in papers with multiple authors, but until corrected I will be sticking with my version.

[2] For which it is a model, but only vacuously.

[3] You might say that the theory generated the model, so that any new properties found in the reals are as much constructed as they are discovered.

[4] Notice that this is exactly the opposite of what happened when we paired S with the six-persion model, which had extra facts left over, even after the fullest application of S.

[5] On the other hand, this could be exactly what Leibniz or Newton (probably newton) had had in mind for calculus.  But, if that is the case then I think it comes not out of necessity for their work, but out of some kind of spiritual leaning regarding ineffability that is probably no longer in vogue, but that is still kicking around in our mathematics.

[6] At this point, it may be natural to wonder what an evenly-powered theory-model-pair looks like.  Each proposition in the theory would match up perfectly to a fact about the model, and each fact about the model would have a corresponding proof in the theory.  In this case there is no apparent reason to prefer reasoning in the theory to reasoning in the model, as they may as well be the same thing--so why bother having two?  In the language of TMMC we would say that the explanation function between them is a homeomorphism.

[7] Another question that arises here is: What if a theory overpowers a model for some cases, but is underpowered in the model for others?  It is hoped that TMMC can identify these areas, at which point it would be up to the critic to decide whether the particular distribution of power was appropriate.

[8] It is hoped that TMMC can one day be extended beyond mathematical theories as a a sort of semantic analytics tool.  However, we are already casting our net pretty wide here, so at least for the present we will restrict our focus to mathematics.

[9] It is tempting to call T the set of *all* propositions, but until we are clear on just what a proposition is, we can't be sure that this is not paradoxical.  This shall be discussed soon, but for now feel free to exclude from T any propositions about T itself, anything having to do with barbers, and any other propositions you feel might be troubling.

[10] If TMMC grows up to be the kind of theory I have in mind, an better word might be *communication*
