    telescope:
        parameters: X, Y
        payload:
            "This document is about x in exactly the same way that astronomy is about telescopes--that is to say, it isn't.
            X was chosen for the structure of the relationships to its adjacent terms.

    aimless:
        payload:
            "This might not actually reflect my views--if consistent persistent views are something I have at all.
            It is a rabbit hole dug for the purpose of seeing where it goes, not for getting anywhere."

            This is a context free zone, fish!
            Some bits of discourse aims to respond to other bits in some way, this doesn't--or at least I will not be behaving as if it does.
            Whether you should treat it as such depends on how you feel about 'The Death of The Author' (google it).
