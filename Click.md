Click.

It is the sound of a Cherry MX Blue--arguably the best keyswitch for typing.
Arguable because maybe you don't need the whole house to know that you're typing.
Best because there is a little tiny gavel in each one that--no matter how gingerly you caress the key--hammers down with the force of 2.4*10^-19 atomic bombs.
"I'm not sure whether the key actually got pressed," said nobody ever while typing on Cherry MX Blues.

Despite being absolutely, positively, the sound that a Cherry MX Blue would make--a sound whose whole point is to have no duration, to mark a single moment and only that moment--the scientists assure us that it is still happening.
Not like the "click click click click," which is what is coming from the keys at my fingertips as I type this, but like "clicccccccc....." on for ever.
Except that there never really was a "cli..." and maybe there will never really be a "..k."

The whole click is there in the signal, but the front and back of it, they say, are "non-local".
Usually, when they say this, they are pointing at a pair of graphs, one of whose axes appears to be approaching a vertical asymtote according to the other.
They make about as much sense of it as they ever do.

Apparently, if you're on a finite timeline, and you have a deadline tomorrow, you can just hang a left.
Your new time axis runs parallel to the deadline, so they never intersect, and you never have to go to work again.
The math all checks out, we're told--it's just that nobody has figured out how to actually do this.
Not even the guy that pressed the big omnipresent MX Blue in the sky--he's non-local too.
Whatever happened when he pressed that key, it may have set our clocks on a path where they would never see his deadline, but there's no reason to believe that it will save him.

What is he writing?

Some say that he had been up all night writing the laws of physics into a computer program, and that the click that we're hearing is the enter key that God pressed to start the universe running.
This is, unsuprisingly, the position of the scientists who discovered the signal.
Newton would have been one of these, had he live at the right time--Plato too.
Little has changed for them, they're still bickering with the mathematicians about which language the universe is written in, and whether we'd notice if the program halted.

Others think it's a work of fiction.
Well, fiction for him at least.
The more optimistic of these think it's his first keystroke--a shift key to make the 'O' in "Once upon a time..."
Whether it's a story about them, and whether they turn out to be a hero or a villain, comes down to how hero-worthy or villain-worthy their life turns out to be.

Hundreds of variations of the "which key?" story have emerged.
Each, like these, comes equipped with its own particular philosophical--and ultimately political--overtones.
Fractures appeared among even the most cohesive societies:
The debate over whether the pope had the right to chose the church's favored key has bumbled on awkwardly for years now.
It has become apparent that the two-party system is unstabe in a universe that thinks it was created on a 105-key keyboard.
The last thing we all needed was yet another thing for schoolchildren to form cliques over.

Three years ago, the largest sensor array on the planet was completed and powered on--we needed to know.
It was theorized that despite the non-locality of the click as we hear it, there would be other objects in the author's world that it was local to.  If there was any delay at all when our world forked off orthognally to the author's timeline, the sound should have reflected off of the neighboring keys.  With a good enough sampling of the signal, we might be able to build a map.

Almost immediately they ruled out the possibility of the click having come from a spacebar--but nobody was suprised by this, spacebars sound much different than other keys due to their shape.
Since then, the facility has remained silent--aware of the societal impact of an announcement, they have promised to keep quiet until they were absolutely sure.

That is, until today: it's a backspace.
The talking heads are still working to adjust their worldviews so that they can have been right all along.
It will probably only take a few hours.
But until that happens, the world is quiet except for a small handful.

105 keys, 9 billion people--somebody was bound to be right.
According to them, everything to the left of the cursor is unchangeable to us.
There it is written that the speed of light is about three hundred mega-meters per second, and pointed out that farts are funny.
Moments before the backspace happened, there was also text describing what we were all going to do next.
Perhaps not for the rest of eternity, but long enough that we would have no choice but carry it out for the time being.

When the author backspaced over that text, he freed us from his plans.
We are the potentiality that he decided against--and at the moment of deletion the burden of experiencing us transfered from his mind, to ours.
Our reality, according to the backspacers, is where that particular fiction went because it failed to stick to the page.

I probably should give this more time to sink in, maybe sleep on it, but I'm delerious with the concept.
In a certain sense it has always been known that you could create a universe in your mind and then capture it on the page, but to think that all of the alternative worlds--worlds created by every edit, every time you forgot to save--would continue on without you...
It's fantastic.

Now, it might be nothing, but there is a rumor that began circulating a week before the announcement.
The rumor correctly predicted both the timing of the announcement and the announced key.
According to the rumor, they found something more.
Supposedly there's a second signal, and "it looks like text."

Now, I have a deadline coming up, and I don't know how to make the kind of left turn that avoids the arrival of tomorrow.
Not for myself at least.
Before I get to work, I'm going to backspace over this entire story.
If it shows up in your cosmic background, I'll have no way of knowing, but you'll know that I went to work so that you could keep on being a dream.

And if you feel like it, write me into some unfinished fiction of your own, even if only for a moment.
With a bit of luck, we'll build an even bigger sensor and discover your story written on our sky.
