You are Here, a Logical Metatheory of Knowability
=================================================



The idea that you have to start somewhere is a familliar one in philosophy.
Another familliar problem arises when you would like a way to justify a theory of justification.
Can we trust a theory to justify itself?
Can we trust whatever theory we currently embrace to fairly evaluate an alternative?
In both cases, probably not.
Ultimately, it must fall to a choice that we make without epistemic justification.

For example, in this paper I will embrace the law of noncontradiction--not because it's true, but because it's useful.
Since doing so is a conventional move, I will give no futher explanation for that particular principle.
But there are other principles that are not so conventional, and they should probably be explained.
This happens with an argument, so it may seem like I think I can prove something--but it will be an argument in a vacuum, devoid of the necessary framework to evaluate things like soundness.
Soundness is not what you want behind your axioms anyway--I merely hope that it clarifies my motivations.

There has been some talk of known-uknowns and unknown-unknowns; in the first section of this paper, my argument in-vacuo aims establish a third category, known-unknowables.
Given that there are known unknowables, it might be a good idea to amend the logic we use in epistemology so that we avoid accidental dependency on such a thing.
In the second section I provide a few modifications to traditional logic that can help us avoid making such an error.
These modifications are primarily aimed at preventing the scope of existential quantifiers from including an unknowable proposition.
In section three I will use my new logic to analyze an argument against relativism provided by Welshon, there I will demonstrate that it is a useful way of handling relativist claims.

The goal of this theory is to achieve a sort of tranlation mechanism between a highly relativized argument and a traditional one.
In at least some cases, there is no practical difference between objectively-true and true-according-to-the-best-theory-available.
People who argue one way or another are using different words, but often make the same considerations.
Ideally, the theory presented here could provide a translation mechansim between these two modes, and then the whole depate can collapse into a duality of linguistic choices.
Realistically, there probably are differences between these kinds of thinking that cannot be resolved by logical trickery.
If so, I hope that we can at least augment relativist arguments with a logical underpinning that alows them to be criticized in a systematic way:
Maybe a relativist is never wrong, but with a bit of relativism of our own we can at least show that a misbehaving relativist is relatively useless.
