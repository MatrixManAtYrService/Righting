\section{Theorem Space}

Let \(T\) be a set, the elements of which are either axioms or theorems.
We propose a topology \(h\) given by:

\[h = {S \subset T : \text{for each} s \in S \text{one of the following is true:}
        s \text{is an axiom}
    s \text{is a theorem that can be proven from axioms in S}}\]
