# How Javascript Killed The Web Site

... or maybe...

# How to make complexity the enemy of diversity

Do you remember web sites?
If not, consider [this one](https://www.warnerbros.com/archive/spacejam/movie/jam.htm).
The constraints on its design were minimal--it was tailored for one job:
It is *the* SpaceJam web page.
It is not the spacejam entry on imdb, not the facebook event page for the spacejam release party, and not a page full of search results regarding how I can download a copy of space jam.

There was a time when businesses far and wide realized: "we need a web site."
"If we had a web site", they said to themselves, "there would be one single place where people could go on the web to get information on what we're about.
It would be ours, so we could make it exactly how we wanted it to be, think of the time we would save answering phone calls.
Hell, we could even stop advertizing in the yellow pages."
For a little while, they made sites like the one I have linked to above, but something has happened.

Recently, I wanted to know whether a certain place was open on new years day.
Google said they were, with a warning that they might be wrong due to the holiday.
The company website didn't say one way or another, neither did facebook.
Yelp agreed with google, but without a warning.
I ended up calling them on the telephone like it was 1985--they were open until 5:00, which isn't what google said.

How did we get here?
I get the feeling that a smaller percentage of businesses have their own web sites now than did five years ago.
Instead, they're on a smattering of social media sites.

From an application developer's perspective, this makes sense.
There are millions of businesses, but each one is an instance of maybe just a few hundred types of business.
The same goes for individuals, governments, religions, and whatever other entities might want to have web sites--why reinvent the wheel for each one?

But as a user, it makes no sense at all.
A man with a single clock knows what time it is, but a man with two is never sure.
